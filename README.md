# ABOUT ME
A novice Java developer, interested in developing in software development. I strive for users to be able to get a convenient and pleasant to use product that works stably. I am fond of new technologies that can improve the quality of work. I know how to set goals and achieve them. I'm not afraid of difficulties.
## Technical stack
**Languages:** Java, Python(Basic level), Kotlin <br/>
**Frameforks:** Spring (Beginning level) <br/>

# IMPLEMENTED PROJECTS
## IMAGE CONVERSION TO TEXT GRAPHICS 
- As part of the course project, I developed a program for converting images (jpg, png, etc.) on the server to text graphics under Windows OS, for PCs and mobile devices.
- Implemented the ability to automatically compress the image if the image size exceeded the maximum specified dimensions. I prepared a solution using only the conditional if operator, without the While operator, which accelerated the work of the program. 
- Implemented the ability to output the result to the website and console. 
- To build the output, I used StringBuilder to speed up the application. 
- Used WritableRaster for image work and net.URL for interacting with images from the internet. 
- **Technology stack: Java language, IntelliJ IDEA development environment, ImageIO, awt Bufferedimage.** <br/>
<br/>
## PROGRAM "CONTACTS" 
- To practice skills, I developed from scratch an application for managing contacts (Android platform).
- Implemented the following features: - Create and delete contacts (full name and phone number). - Ability to create groups of contacts, for example, "family", "colleagues", "friends". - The function of searching for contacts by groups, names and phone. 
- **Technology stack: Java, IntelliJ IDEA development environment** <br/>
